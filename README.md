# NC News

Northcoders News is a social news aggregation, web content rating, and discussion website based on Reddit. It was built over 2 weeks to demonstrate skills learnt during my time at Northcoders. NC News was built using React, Reach Router and styled with Styled Components.

It was built using this [backend](https://github.com/ricojamjar/nc-news), which is hosted [here](https://rich-james-nc-news.herokuapp.com/api/). The deployed version is available [here](https://rich-nc-news.netlify.com/).

## Getting Started

If you would like to get my site up and running on your own machine please follow these instructions.
First, install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) v10.15.3 or above and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) v6.9.0 or above.
Once both NPM and Node.js have been set up clone or fork this repo and run `npm install` from the NC-News folder. This will download and install all the dependencies necessary to run the file.
Once dependencies are installed run `npm start` from the NC-News folder. This should cause the NC News homepage to open in your default browser.
